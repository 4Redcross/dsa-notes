## 3 Pillars of Good code 
### 1. Readable - can be easily made out by other people working on our programs
### 2. Scalable - should not fail when number of inputs increase
### i) Speed - Time Complexity (quick code saves time and money)
### ii) Memory - Space Complexity (no infinite memory available)


### Remember, good coders - 
#### Use appropriate _data structures_ + Proper _algorithms_ = Make good _programs_
