When talking about heaps, you will most likely be referring to _binary heaps_. These are trees in the two children nodes of a parent node are always less or more than them depending on its type, the order of these siblings is not taken into consideration

As you can see, binary heaps can be of two types - 
1. All sub-nodes go in decreasing order OR
2. All sub-nodes go in increasing order

- **Also note that binary heaps are always balanced, thus there is no concept of an unbalanced binary heap, so we don't have to deal with balancing it**
- Binary heaps follow a left to right insertion pattern where the empty spaces moving from left to right in lowest level of the tree are filled in.
- Unlike binary trees, heaps can be implemented using arrays instead of nodes

#### Operation complexities for binary heaps - 
1. lookup - O(n)
2. insert - O(logN) 
3. delete - O(logN)
	both insert and delete have O(1) complexity in best case

>[!note] Bubbling up
>When a node is added or deleted from a binary heap, if the property of binary heap is not maintained (increasing/decreasing order) , then a operation known as **Bubbling-up** is performed where a defective node is bubbled up until the heap follows its property

>[!caution] Heaps in languages
>You should remember that the heap data-structure **IS NOT** memory heap that you hear about when you learn languages such as JavaScript.

>_They are not related to each other **AT ALL**, the naming convention is simply co-incidental _

### Priority Queues - 
- These are extension of queues into binary heaps, consider that the nodes with higher priority will get to be put above nodes with lower priority.
- This is useful in cases where you want to release a queue according to priority

	E.g. _a night club guard is letting people in according to FIFO, but suddenly VIP guests arrive, then the VIPs are given higher priority and allowed to enter in their own order before the normal guests_


#### Advantages of using Binary heaps - 
1. Better operations than O(n) required in arrays or hash Tables
2. Allow the concept of priority
3. Can be flexible in size according to your needs
4. Have a fast insert times most of the times 

#### Disadvantages of Binary heaps - 
- Slow lookup times
