Hash Tables store data in the form of 'key - value' pairs, you can simply query the key to get the value associated with it 

##### Different operation complexities in Hash Tables
1. O(1) - Lookup *
2. O(1) - insertion
3. O(1) - deletion

	 Note that insertion and deletion in hash tables is quick because all data stored is unordered, thus the data structure doesn't have to loop over itself to order the other items


##### Hashing 

Under the hood, hash tables are associated with a `hash function` that basically takes a query `key` performs certain has operation on it and based on the hash generated it then decides where to look for value in memory.

This introduces another problem, as you may know different arguments can generate the same hash, there are techniques of a work around on this issue, such as chaining of values on the same memory location. 

 - * Thus the lookup has time complexity depends on situation and number of chains that query might have to go through

#### Building a Hash Table

``` Python
class myHashMap():  
	def __init__(self, size=50):  
		self.data = [None] * size  
	  
	def set(self, key, value):  
		index = self._hash(key)  
		if not self.data[index]:  
		self.data[index] = []  
		self.data[index].append([key, value])  
	  
	def get(self, key=None):  
		if key:  
			index = self._hash(key)  
			if self.data[index]:  
				for i in self.data[index]:  
					if i[0] == key:  
						return i[1]  
				return 'No such key'  
		else:  
			return self.data  
	  
	def keys(self):  
		keys = []  
		for i in self.data:  
			if i is not None:  
				for j in i:  
					keys.append(j[0])  
		return keys  
	  
	def _hash(self, key):  
		hash = 0  
		for i in range(len(key)):  
			hash = (hash + ord(key[i]) * i) % len(self.data)  
		return hash

newHash = myHashMap(size=3)  
newHash.set("Abhijeet", "Pawar")  
newHash.set("Ravindra", "Jadeja")  
newHash.set("MS", "Dhoni")  
newHash.set("Tetra", "Cross")  
print(newHash.get("Ravi"))  
print(newHash.get())  
print(newHash.keys())
```

##### When to use a Hash Table - 
- Faster lookups * (depends if there is no collision) 
- Faster insertions
- Data is not stored in ordered form, thus no need to make it ordered after deleting an element

##### When NOT to use a Hash Table- 
- Unordered - You cannot access data one after other (exception python which recently made its dictionaries ordered)
- Its slower to iterate over all keys


>[!imp] Note this!
>Hash tables will always be used to improve your time complexity but it comes at the cost of memory
