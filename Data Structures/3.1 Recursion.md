It's not really a algorithm, its more of a concept. It will be used a lot when searching or sorting through BSTs. 
Recursion occurs when a function refers to itself with itself. 
Recursion is useful when there are repeated sub-tasks to be performed within a task

>[!warning] Look out 
>Recursion is a very dangerous topic, as not enough understanding of its working can easily cause you to run out of memory if the function is calling itself infinitely without breaking out from nested calls. Thus you need a way for the function to break our of this loop, this is known as a *base case* 


Take a look at the following lines of recursive code - 
```python
counter = 0
def inception:
	# Base case
	if(counter > 3):
		return 'done!'
	
	
	counter += 1

	# Recursive case
	return inception()

inception()
```

There are 3 main rules when it comes to applying recursion - 
1. Identify the base case 
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Go closer and closer until you achieve the base case and return when needed. Thus giving you **two** returns in a recursive function
