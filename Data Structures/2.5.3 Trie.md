A trie is a data structure that can have multiple links unlike Binary tree or binary heap, where a parent node has connection to only a single child node. _It is also known as prefix tree_.

They excel by using a lot less memory than simply storing each word in memory, instead they'll only have reference to 26 letters in memory and make use of links to store rest of the words.

##### Applications of Trie - 
1. IP look-ups
2. Auto completions
3. Word corrections
