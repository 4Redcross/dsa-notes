>[!tip] High - Level
>Stacks and queues are high level implementations of some low level data structures such as Arrays, hash tables, linked lists
### Stacks - 
Imagine this data structure as _stack of plates_, where you can only access the top-most plate
This is known as **LIFO** (Last in first out)
##### Operations complexities of Stacks - 
1. pop - O(1)
2. push - O(1)
3. peek - O(1)
##### Implementing Stacks - 
- For Stacks, its simply a personal preference on whether you'd like to use arrays or linked lists with each having their own pros and cons
- Arrays offer you faster lookups due to being stored right next to each other in memory space and also take up less memory as they don't have to store pointers like linked lists
- Linked Lists on the other hand offer dynamic allocation of memory which means you can increase or decrease the size of your data dynamically
- 
### Queues - 
This data structure is exactly like queues where the first person/element to join the structure is the first one to go out.
This is known as **FIFO** (First in first out)
#### Operation complexities of Queues - 
1. enqueue - O(1)
2. dequeue - O(1)
3. peek - O(1)

>[!caution] Arrays and Queues
>It is a bad practice to implement Queues using arrays as dequeue operation will require the array to shift the indexes of all items by 1
