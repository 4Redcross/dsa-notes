Algorithms are simply lines of code designed to solve a particular use case ex. algorithm to sort through files in a system, algorithm to train a ML model etc. Thus it can be 2 line or even thousand line code.

From what we've learned about data structures up until this point, algorithms help us make use of the data structures, data types to design programs. Algorithms will help us reduce the time complexities of various programs down to suitable time-periods for business needs. It signifies that you may go long without knowing much about algorithms but when the company starts to get bigger and bigger and the data that you may need to deal with gets larger, you start having problems. Algorithms help solve these problems
